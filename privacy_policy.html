			<h2 id="bp-03">Applicable Legal Bases</h2>
			<p>
				Below, you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which
				we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the
				provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations in your or
				our country of residence or establishment may apply. Furthermore, if
				specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform
				you of these in the privacy policy.
			</p>
			<h4>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</h4>
			<p>
				The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal
				data for one or more specific purposes.
			</p>

			<h4>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</h4>
			<p>
				Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
				controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden
				by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
				requiring the protection of personal data.
			</p>
			<h4>National Data Protection Regulations in Germany:</h4>
			<p>
				In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, there are
				national data protection regulations in Germany. This includes, in
				particular, the Law for the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data
				in Data Processing (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG). The BDSG contains
				specific provisions regarding the right to information, the right to
				deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of
				personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission, as well
				as automated decision-making on an individual basis, including
				profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws of individual federal
				states may also apply.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Reference to the Applicability of GDPR and Swiss Data Protection Act:
			</h4>
			<p>
				These data protection notices serve both to provide information in
				accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (Schweizer DSG)
				and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason,
				please note that, for the sake of broader spatial applicability and
				understanding, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, the terms
				"processing" of "personal data," "legitimate interest," and "special
				categories of data" as used in the GDPR are used instead of the terms
				used in the Swiss DSG. However, the legal meaning of these terms is
				determined within the scope of the Swiss DSG's applicability in
				accordance with the Swiss DSG.
			</p>

			<h2 id="bp-04">Security Measures</h2>
			<p>
				According to legal requirements and considering the state of the art,
				implementation costs, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of
				processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of risks to
				the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we implement suitable
				technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection
				appropriate to the risk.
			</p>
			<p>
				These measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality,
				integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and
				electronic access to the data, as well as related access, input,
				disclosure, availability, and separation. Additionally, we have
				established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights,
				data deletion, and responses to data breaches. Furthermore, we consider
				data protection during the development or selection of hardware,
				software, and processes, following the principles of data protection by
				design and by default.
			</p>
			<h2 id="bp-05">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
			<p>
				Rights of Data Subjects under the GDPR: You, as data subjects, have
				various rights under the GDPR, particularly arising from Articles 15 to
				21 of the GDPR:

			<p>
				You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your
				particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you
				which is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR, including profiling based
				on those provisions. If personal data concerning you is processed for
				direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to
				the processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing,
				including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct
				marketing.
			</p>

			<h4>Right to Withdraw Consent:</h4>

				you is being processed, as well as information about this data and a
				copy of the data in accordance with legal requirements.

			<h4>Right to Rectification:</h4>
			<p>
				You have the right to request the completion of data concerning you or
				the rectification of inaccurate data concerning you in accordance with
				legal requirements.
			</p>

			<h4>Right to Erasure and Restriction of Processing:</h4>
			<p>
				You have the right, in accordance with legal requirements, to request
				the erasure of data concerning you without undue delay or alternatively,
				the restriction of processing in accordance with legal requirements.
