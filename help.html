      <h2>What is Join?</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="accentuated">Join</span>
        is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group
        of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the
        Developer Akademie.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
        method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
        efficiency (or flow). <span class="accentuated">Join</span>
        leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and
        projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It is important to note that <span class="accentuated">Join</span> is
        designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive

        experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability,

      <h2>How to use it</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
        <span class="accentuated">Join</span> :

          <td class="step-content">
            <h3 class="list-heading">Exploring the Board</h3>
            When you log in to <span class="accentuated">Join</span>
            , you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
            and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
            feedback” and "Done".
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="step-nmbr">2.</td>
          <td class="step-content">
            <h3 class="list-heading">Creating Contacts</h3>
            In <span class="accentuated">Join</span>
            , you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
            "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
            information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and
            they can interact with the tasks on the board.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="step-nmbr">3.</td>
          <td class="step-content">
            <h3 class="list-heading">Adding Cards</h3>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
            Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
            appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
            the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="step-nmbr">4.</td>
          <td class="step-content">
            <h3 class="list-heading">Moving Cards</h3>
            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
            the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
            another.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="step-nmbr">5.</td>
          <td class="step-content">
            <h3 class="list-heading">Deleting Cards</h3>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list
            or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the
            board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action
            is irreversible.
